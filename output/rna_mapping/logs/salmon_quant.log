[2023-07-23 23:19:21.354] [jointLog] [info] The --mimicBT2, --mimicStrictBT2 and --hardFilter flags imply mapping validation (--validateMappings). Enabling mapping validation.
[2023-07-23 23:19:21.354] [jointLog] [info] Usage of --validateMappings implies use of minScoreFraction. Since not explicitly specified, it is being set to 0.65
[2023-07-23 23:19:21.354] [jointLog] [info] The use of range-factorized equivalence classes does not make sense in conjunction with --hardFilter.  Disabling range-factorized equivalence classes.
